1. Define a class `Solution` with a public method `removeKdigits` that takes a string `S` and an integer `K` as input and returns a string.
2. Inside the method:
   - If `K` is equal to the length of string `S`, return "0".
   - Create an empty stack of characters (`st`).
   - Iterate through each character of string `S`:
     - While the stack is not empty, `K` is greater than 0, and the top element of the stack is greater than the current character, pop elements from the stack and decrement `K`.
     - Push the current character onto the stack.
   - After the iteration, if there are remaining `K` elements to remove, pop them from the stack.
   - Create an empty string `ans`.
   - Pop elements from the stack and append them to `ans`.
   - Reverse the string `ans`.
   - Remove leading zeros from `ans`.
   - If `ans` becomes empty after removing leading zeros, return "0".
   - Return the modified string `ans`.

3. In the `main` function:
   - Create an instance of the `Solution` class (`sol`).
   - Read input from the user: a string `num` and an integer `k`.
   - Call the `removeKdigits` method of the `sol` instance with the input string `num` and integer `k`.
   - Output the result.

This algorithm essentially removes `K` digits from the input string `S` to make the resulting string as small as possible while maintaining the same relative order of digits.
