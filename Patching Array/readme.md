Here's the algorithm for the provided code:

1. **Input**: Read an array of integers `nums` and an integer `n` from the user.
2. **Initialize variables**: 
   - Initialize `patches` to count the patches required.
   - Initialize `i` to iterate over `nums`.
   - Initialize `sz` to store the size of `nums`.
   - Initialize `count` to track the current sum, starting with 1.
3. **Loop until `count` exceeds `n`**:
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `i` is less than `sz` and the current element `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `count`, add `nums[i]` to `count` and increment `i`.
     - Otherwise, double `count` and increment `patches`.
4. **Return `patches`**: Once the loop exits, return the value of `patches`.
5. **Output**: Display the result obtained from step 4.

This algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum number of patches required to cover the range `[1, n]` using the sorted integer array `nums` by iteratively extending the current sum `count`.
