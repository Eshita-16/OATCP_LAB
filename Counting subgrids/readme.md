Algorithm step by step:

1. **Preprocessing Function (`preprocess_grid`)**:
   - This function converts the input grid, which is represented as a 2D vector of integers, into a compressed form.
   - It initializes a new 2D vector called `processed_grid` to store the compressed representation.
   - For each cell in the input grid, if the value is 1 (indicating a point), it sets the corresponding bit in the `processed_grid` to 1.
   - By compressing the grid in this way, it reduces memory usage and speeds up subsequent operations by working directly with bits.

2. **Counting Subgrids Function (`count_subgrid`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of subgrids formed by points in the input grid.
   - It iterates through all pairs of rows in the grid (denoted by variables `a` and `b`).
   - For each pair of rows, it counts the number of common points using bitwise AND operation (`&`) on their respective processed rows.
   - The `__builtin_popcount` function calculates the number of set bits (1s) in the result of the AND operation, effectively counting the number of common points.
   - It then uses a formula to calculate the number of unique subgrids formed by these common points. This formula is derived from combinatorial principles and accounts for combinations of common points that can form different subgrids.
   - Finally, it accumulates the count of subgrids.

3. **Main Function**:
   - It reads the size of the grid and grid data from the input file.
   - Then, it calls the preprocessing function to convert the grid into the compressed form.
   - Next, it calls the function to count the number of subgrids.
   - Finally, it writes the result to the output file.

This algorithm efficiently handles large grids by compressing them into a more compact representation and then performing bitwise operations to count subgrids, resulting in faster execution.
