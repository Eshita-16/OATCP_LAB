1. Create a class Solution to encapsulate the algorithm.
2. Define a function validArrangement that takes a vector of pairs as input and returns a vector of vectors representing the valid arrangement.
3. Inside validArrangement:
    a. Initialize variables and data structures:
        - Initialize variables m, start to -1.
        - Create unordered_maps adj, in, and out to store adjacency list, in-degree, and out-degree of each node respectively.
    b. Populate adj, in, and out maps based on the input pairs.
    c. Determine the starting node for the Eulerian path:
        - Iterate through the adjacency list and find a node with out-degree - in-degree == 1.
        - If found, set it as the start node. Otherwise, start at any node.
    d. Call the euler function to find the Eulerian path starting from the determined start node.
    e. Reverse the order of the Eulerian path to obtain the final valid arrangement.
    f. Return the valid arrangement.

4. Define a private function euler that takes adjacency list adj, vector of vectors ans, and the current node curr as input.
5. Inside euler:
    a. Get the stack of neighbors for the current node.
    b. While the stack is not empty:
        - Pop a neighbor from the stack.
        - Recursively call euler for the neighbor.
        - Append the current node and the neighbor to the answer.
6. In the main function:
    a. Read the number of pairs from the input.
    b. Read the pairs from the input and store them in a vector of vectors pairs.
    c. Create an instance of the Solution class.
    d. Call the validArrangement function with the pairs as input and store the result.
    e. Check if the result is valid:
        - If the size of the result vector is not equal to the number of pairs, print "No valid arrangement possible".
        - Otherwise, print each pair in the result.
7. Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
