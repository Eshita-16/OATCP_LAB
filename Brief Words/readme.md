1. Include necessary libraries: iostream, fstream, vector, unordered_set.
2. Define a function generateShortForms that takes a word as input and returns a vector of its short forms.
3. Inside generateShortForms:
    a. Initialize an unordered_set called shortForms to store unique short forms.
    b. Get the length of the word and store it in variable n.
    c. Generate all possible subsequences of lengths 1 to 4:
        - Iterate over each character index i from 0 to n-1.
        - Initialize an empty string sub.
        - Append the character at index i to sub and insert it into shortForms.
        - Iterate over each character index j from i+1 to n-1:
            - Append the character at index j to sub and insert it into shortForms.
            - Iterate over each character index k from j+1 to n-1:
                - Append the character at index k to sub and insert it into shortForms.
                - Iterate over each character index l from k+1 to n-1:
                    - Append the character at index l to sub and insert it into shortForms.
                    - Remove the last character from sub.
                - Remove the last character from sub.
            - Remove the last character from sub.
        - Remove the last character from sub.
    d. Convert shortForms set to a vector and return it.

4. In the main function:
    a. Open an input file stream (inputFile) to read from "input.txt" and an output file stream (outputFile) to write to "output.txt".
    b. Read the number of distinct words (n) from the input file.
    c. Create a vector called words of size n to store the distinct words.
    d. Read each distinct word from the input file and store it in the words vector.
    e. For each word in the words vector:
        - Call generateShortForms function to get its short forms.
        - Write "Short forms for word: " followed by the word to the output file.
        - Write each short form followed by a space to the output file.
        - Write a newline character to the output file.
    f. Close the input and output file streams.
    g. Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
